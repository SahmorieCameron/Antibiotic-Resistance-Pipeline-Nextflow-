Patient - 1 doesn't have TetA.v1_2317 or TetB.v2_2325 resistance in srst2 result. They should be prescribed priority 1 antibiotic: Doxcycline.

Patient - 2 has "tetA.v1_2317" in srst2 result. They should not be prescribed tetracyclines - Tet* mediates resistance to tetracyclines and Dexocycline would fail.
Patient - 2 has also has resistances to all Aminoglycosides (aph3''-Ib_146	aph6-Id.v1_171	sat-2_193	strA.v1_2409	strB.v1_2410) in srst2 result. Therefore, they should get antibiotic with next
priority: Chloramphenicol.

Patient - 3 has "tetB.v2_2325" in srst2 result which confers resistance to Tetracyclines. Patient 3 should get antibiotic with next priority: gentamycin.
